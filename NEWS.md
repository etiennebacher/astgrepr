# astgrepr 0.0.10

* In several lints can be fixed but overlap, the first lint is fixed but those
  that are nested in it are ignored. The text output of `tree_rewrite()` now
  has an attribute `has_skipped_fixes` indicating if some lints were not fixed
  because they were nested (#34).

# astgrepr 0.0.6

* Replacing text that contains escaping characters (e.g. in regular expressions)
  doesn't remove those characters anymore.

* Replacing text now takes into account leading empty lines.

  rules stored in `any_duplicated.yml` only. Accepts several rules separated
